# web scraping using selenium 

In this code I scrapped data from MagicBricks website for Data Analysis to understand the apartment price in Bengalore. 

## Installation 
1. pip install selenium
2. download compitable chrome driver

## Run
To run the code , run the task.py file in terminal (make sure the chrome driver path is set up as per your choice).

It will generate CSV file with all the data.
